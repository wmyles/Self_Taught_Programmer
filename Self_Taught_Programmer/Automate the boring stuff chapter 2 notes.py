#boolean data type has two values: True and False

#Operator Meaning
#== Equal to
#!= Not equal to
#< Less than
#> Greater than
#<= Less than or equal to
#>= Greater than or equal to

#difference between == and =
    #= stores the value on the right into the variable on left while == is a true false question

#Boolean operators
    # and, or, not, are the three boolean operators that compare boolean values
    #Binary Boolean Operators
        #and or or always take two boolean values(binary) if both values are true then it returns true
    #not operator
        #not evaluates a boolean value to the opposite(makes Truth false and vice versa)

#conditions
    #same as expressions, evaluates down to a boolean value

#three rules for blocks of code
    #1.Blocks begin when the indentation increases.
    #2.Blocks can contain other blocks.
    #3.Blocks end when the indentation decreases to zero or to a containing blockâ€™s indentation.
#rest of chapter can be seen in the next code

#if statement
    #if if statement is true it evalueates the block, else it skips it. remember to follow up if conditions with a colon
#else statements use it at the end of code to issue alternative command if everything before it is false(this guarantees that at least one line is executed if conditions aren't met

#elif evaluates condition if everything else above it is false 
    #ORDER IS IMPORTANT(will evaluate first true statement)
