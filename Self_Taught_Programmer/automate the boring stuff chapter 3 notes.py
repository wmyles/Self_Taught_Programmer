#Chapter 3: Functions
#you can create your own functions in python(main point is to get rid of duplicated code
#usually with -> def variable name:
# you need to call it after defining it aka doing function() outside the code block
#its to group code that gets executed multiple times
#deduplication making code shorter
#when passing print or len function the you pass in values called arguments
#in this code where you have hello(name) name is a parameter and
#when when you put a name-> hello('alice') the argument 'alice' gets passsed
#in short argumnent= the value passed in the function call
# and parameter= the variable inside the function

#return command
#returns a value based off a function(there is example code)
#None function
#when you use the print function it returns a value called None(lack of value and it offers value in coding?)

#keyword argument -> end and sep(noted as not being important)

#error management
#you can use try and except to keep the program running(see example code )

#global and local scope
#variables assigned inside functon=local scope  functions outside global
#important rule to note: 1.code in global scope cant use local variables 2. code in local scope can use global scope
#3.code in one functions local scope cannot use variables in another local scope 4. can use same name in different local scopes
